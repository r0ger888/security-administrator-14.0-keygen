this algo was made of only 7 hardcored chars and i've just used only the randomize routine and the random generation subprogram to generate random numbers, and it did worked with the letters too , not only numbers.
indeed this is the latest version , and i bet this algo was somehow overused in other versions afaik . and yea, this algo is nothing special that much.
